[Slide 1: Introduction]

    Narrator: Our innovative game adds a thrilling twist to the classic pool game you know and love. Players can cast spells like exploding balls, moving pockets, and portals to outsmart their opponents and dominate the table.

[Slide 2: Our Team and Our Process]

    Narrator: Our dedicated team, Josh, Jake, Saif, Waei, and Ken, developed Wizard Pool using an agile programming approach. This ensured flexibility, adaptability, and continuous improvement throughout the development process. By using agile development, we were able to test and refine various aspects of the game, making changes according to our findings. This approach proved more effective than the traditional waterfall development method, enabling us to quickly respond to challenges and deliver a more polished product.

    Our agile approach also involved reassigning team roles and adjusting our priorities as needed. We initially assigned roles based on specific areas of the game, such as gameplay, start screen, or art assets. However, as the project progressed, we opted for a more flexible approach, allocating weekly tasks to each member based on their expertise and the project's needs. This allowed our team to adapt and contribute their unique skills and talents to ensure the success of Wizard Pool.

[Slide 3: Challenges]

    Narrator: We tackled three main challenges while developing Wizard Pool:

    Perfecting realistic game mechanics,
    Incorporating exciting and balanced spell features,
    Creating an intuitive user interface,
    
    We wanted to ensure that the game's physics accurately represented the real-world dynamics of pool, making it immersive and engaging for players.

    We designed a variety of spells that added a unique strategic element to the game, while maintaining balanced gameplay to keep it fair and competitive.

    We focused on developing a user-friendly interface that allowed players to easily understand and interact with the game's features.

[Slide 5: Future Work]

    Narrator: As we look to the future of Wizard Pool, we've identified three key areas for improvement. First, we plan to expand the game by adding more wizard spells and enhancing the game flow. Second, we're focused on enhancing usability based on user feedback. We've already improved the game's UI, making it more intuitive with helpful visual aids. In the future, we aim to further streamline the gameplay experience by adding features like a navigation bar for easy access to options like exiting or resetting the game. Finally we plan to add an online version of the game, complete with a live leaderboard. Together, these improvements will ensure that Wizard Pool continues to captivate and entertain players like never before.
